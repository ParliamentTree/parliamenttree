# Contributing To Parliament Tree

This project is released under the Apache license (see the LICENSE file).  By submitting a pull request to this project on GitHub you are agreeing to contribute your changes under the same license.


## Finding Your Way Around

Lots of the modules in the code have their own README.md file, which explains what that particular module does (or what it _should_ do once you've built it!).  Please read these files.

If you're not sure how or whether to do something, then open or comment on the relevant issue on GitHub, or ask [@ParliamentTree](https://twitter.com/ParliamentTree) on Twitter.


## What To Work On

Have a look in the 'Issues' in this project for things tagged with 'up-for-grabs' to pick something to work on.
Discuss the implementation on the issue if necessary, and then get your pull request submitted!



## Code Style

Python code should generally follow PEP8 styling.  But please don't use hanging indents.  Keep imports ordered alphabetically, grouped into "STANDARD LIB", "THIRD PARTY" and "PARLIAMENT TREE" (see existing files for examples).

HTML, CSS and JS should be indented with spaces.  JS linting things and SCSS stuff TBC.

Java & iOS code - the guidelines for this will be set once someone who seems to know what they're doing takes on the leading of these aspects of the project.  Looking for volunteers.



## Write Tests!

Pull requests submitted without tests may be generally ignored or ridiculed.
